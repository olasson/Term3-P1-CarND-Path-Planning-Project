# Path Planning Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

by olasson

## Introduction

In this project, the goal is to design an algorithm that generates smooth paths for the ego car (the vehicle being directly controlled by the algorithm). The setting is a simulated 3 lane highway populated with traffic. The main, overall goal is to drive a distance of (at least) 4.32 miles with the following constraints:

* The car does not exceed a given speed limit
* The car does not exceed a total acceleration of 10 m/s^2 
* The car does not exceed a total jerk of 10 m/s^3
* The car must not collide with any other vehicle 
* The car must stays in one of the three lanes, except when changing lanes. When a lane change occurs, the car does not spend more than 3 seconds "between" lanes
* The car is able to smoothly change lanes when appropriate
